Such memories simply refuse to go away, however much the young men would like them to. If they could, they would all like to take back their decision to join the army. They also talk about the methods used to entice soldiers to join up. And we see how they now live: disillusioned, slumped on the sofa, drinking beer and smoking joints. In their early twenties, they already seem to have lost most of their youthful energy. These deserters also feel guilty -- not about deserting, but about having taken part in the war in Iraq at all in the first place. The interviews are interspersed with footage of the war and of the homes the deserters have left behind. So why did they ever join up? Boredom, unemployment, lack of self-worth. And -- above all -- the rosy picture painted of the army's role in Iraq: ""I thought I would be feeding hungry children.""","deserter | canada | remembering | u.s. military | iraq veteran ",,,,,,"Fieber Film ",English,Germany,8.0,5,N/A,tt1375668,movie

By the end of the 19th century, however, Olmsted had created hundreds of parks throughout the United States, thus defining landscape design for the country. This film documents the creation of Olmsted's first major work, New York City's Central Park, in 1858. The project was fraught with obstacles - political, financial, and topographical - yet the completed park serves as a testament to Olmsted's unique and pioneering vision. The glory of Olmsted's talent is that he was able to transform acres of raw land into natural art forms for all people to enjoy and appreciate in their own way. Told in the dramatic portrait style developed by award-winning director T. W.

He's a nice guy, hard worker, and dedicated student who wants to win his school's business grant. He loses the grant, then his girlfriend, and suddenly something else is put into limbo: his soul. His mind has had enough of failure. Good guys do not finish first and the darkest part of his subconscious knows this. For a while reason and logic prevail but with another brutal and costly semester on the horizon, the dark side begins to take over. At first it is all fun and games for Owen. He never does anything, he just sets things in motion and things go in his favor. People's funny vices are exposed and Owen's stock rises as others fall. Little by little the consequences become greater and he decides it is time to stop. His mind has other plans and wants to keep playing. Can Owen make things right? Can he succeed in a society that is more about profits than it is principles? What is success? Owen needs to figure it out before he goes crazy and crosses a line he can never return to.","imagination | black and white | thinking out loud | adventurer | guilt ",,,,,,,English,USA,N/A,N/A,N/A,tt2609526,movie

Our young actors take us into a world where social and political issues are actively addressed and young Ben Britten's hatred of all things militaristic is formed. As we explore the music that illustrated that hatred throughout his life, illustrated by new performances and unique observations from experts and friends, we frequently return to dramatic interludes at Gresham's, which cement the narrative - spoken by legendary actor John Hurt. The transcendent music of the War Requiem accompanies the climax of the film, before we return to Gresham's School 2012.","reenactment ",,,,1,4,"Capriol Films ",English,UK,6.3,21,N/A,tt2543298,movie

While they wear the same jersey and ride for the same cause, these four Challengers reflect the genuine diversity that the Habitat Bicycle Challenge embodies: Tyler, a May graduate from Yale, has an intense desire to connect with the people of small-town America; Jordan, a graduate student at the University of Georgia, has been inspired by a serious medical condition to live life to the fullest, with a healthy dose of humor and good-natured zeal; JJ, a 19-year-old rising sophomore at McGill University with no previous cycling experience, has been driven to join the ride by his personal exposure to poverty housing; and Mairin, a recent Yale grad, is an avid athlete and runner who seeks the friendship and bonding that this trip promises. Follow these riders as they visit cities and villages, ride through mountains and valleys, and pedal over 4,000 miles of highways and back-roads across the United States. Watch as they face endless plains and brutal climbs, bitter rain and relentless heat, serious illness and broken bones with the courage and optimism that exemplify this challenge. And join them as they grow from strangers to comrades on their mile-by-mile odyssey from New Haven to San Francisco. Filled with spectacular footage of the ride and set to a stirring, original score, this is the story of HBC as it has never been told. All profits from the documentary will be donated to Habitat for Humanity in an effort to end poverty housing.","bicycle | charity | americana ",,,,,1,"Habitat for Humanity, New Baby James Productions, Yale University ",English,USA,8.1,15,N/A,tt0406821,movie

Abruptly, at his mother's behest, he climbs onto the back of a small motorbike to see the world, May 4, 2009, traveling 8,000km with two men in their early 20s he doesn't know, one from Eastern China, the other from Switzerland, and their friend, a Brazilian cinematographer. Authorities, monks, students and gangsters will join near-death experiences to challenge the foursome's will and outlook on life in Ten Thousand Miles. They bump and wheel, initially a biker's road dream until disasters strike, across vast stretches of icy, snowy spring Himalayas from the religious center of Tibet, Lhasa, through earthquake-ravaged Sichuan to the lightning-rich deserts of Inner Mongolia, dazed at the end by the beat of China's commercial heart, Shanghai, dense with skyscrapers. Ten Thousand Miles is more than just a high-adventure road trip, though: it offers a very rare opportunity to hear the voices of China's coming-of-age adults. The adventurers continually interview young people in remote villages, then bustling urban centers, asking them about their hopes for the future and their dreams, their views of the world. Farmers, gangsters, nomads, musicians and wealthy business people form a vivid tapestry but also give voice to a society that is a key player in 21st century Asia. Woven throughout the story is the rich thread of how the travelers are reshaped by both the dramas and the ordinary people they meet.","china | shanghai | lhasa | tibet | motorcycle ",,,,,,"Leaping Frog Productions ",English,"Canada, Switzerland, China",N/A,N/A,N/A,tt1670346,movie

Partially based on Throwell's personal history, 'Time Stau' expands the narrative from the personal to the global by portraying the fast spreading epidemic of meth destroying lives throughout the world. Dirk Skreber and Zefrey Throwell's first short film collaboration was filmed in Cologne, Germany and takes us along for the ride through a sumptuous tableaux of heartrending narratives of this lost young couple. While most drug films tend to focus on the gutter and the havoc at the end of addiction, this movie concentrates specifically on that incomprehensible moment when ordinary kids throw away their promising young lives and turn towards the dark path of drugs. Seen from their perspective, they are experiencing time travel after simultaneous orgasm while high on meth, seen from the outside they are lost in the fog of drug psychosis. Their lives deteriorate before our eyes, suspended in their own time slip, as they lose all sense of self, friends and family, surrendering to the irresistible lure of the drug and the incomprehensible mystery of addiction.","time travel | germany | cologne | art | leopold hoesch museum ","20,000",,,,,,"German, English","Germany, USA",N/A,N/A,N/A,tt2769656,movie

The proceedings are liberally sprinkled with clips from Fassbinder's films, as well as glimpses of a theater company in Los Angeles that specializes in performing the director's plays.

The journey of a father and son turns into a musical trip into the emotional memory and the history of Finnish immigration in Sweden; of shame, guilt, crime, alcoholism, and family secrets. ""Finnish Blood Swedish Heart"" tells the personal story of a father and a son, but also that of those 600,000 Finns who moved to Sweden in the 1960's-1970's as migrant workers escaping the huge unemployment in Finland. Around 200,000 of them returned back to Finland in the 1980s. Kai and Tauno were among those who returned. The film creates a special cinematic genre of its own. While being a documentary, it also is a road movie, and a musical. The musical backbone of the film is formed by songs written in the 1970's by the first generation of Finnish immigrants in Sweden, and performed live in the film by second generation Swedish-Finnish musicians.","sweden | finland | 1970s | alcoholism | musician ",,,,,7,"Hysteria Film AB, Klaffi Productions ","Swedish, Finnish","Finland, Sweden",7.2,242,N/A,tt1411274,movie

Introducing Joy Rose, mother of 4, lead singer of Housewives on Prozac and founder of Mamapalooza Festivals, Frump from Texas, Placenta from California, the Mydols Detroit and a comic from Nashville. The concept and reality are humorous, fast paced and intense. Each of the bands is a completely different entity, each member with unique passions, duties and agendas. Being in a band is likened to being in a marriage and these groups of women formed during and after family life. Never mind the laundry, the balancing act only intensifies as tasks increase with both family and blossoming new musical careers. One thing that the documentary exposes is how hard working and dedicated these women are to playing music in order to inspire others to express themselves somehow, all the while maintaining enormous daily responsibility. MOMz HOT ROCKs is both a documentary and a music video, it combines the best of both of these genres and brings the audience an entertaining look into how women--MOMz, take on the world, manage their full lives and make music to rock your socks off.","mother | rock music | rock 'n' roll ",,,,,8,"Edendale Pictures ",English,USA,N/A,N/A,N/A,tt1329406,movie

Fresh off of a successful production of Death of a Salesman, he has traded in the suburban blue-hairs and regional theater of Schenectady for the cultured audiences and bright footlights of Broadway. Armed with a MacArthur grant and determined to create a piece of brutal realism and honesty, something into which he can put his whole self, he gathers an ensemble cast into a warehouse in Manhattan's theater district. He directs them in a celebration of the mundane, instructing each to live out their constructed lives in a small mock-up of the city outside. As the city inside the warehouse grows, Caden's own life veers wildly off the tracks. The shadow of his ex-wife Adele, a celebrated painter who left him years ago for Germany's art scene, sneers at him from every corner. Somewhere in Berlin, his daughter Olive is growing up under the questionable guidance of Adele's friend, Maria. He's helplessly driving his marriage to actress Claire into the ground. Sammy Barnathan, the actor Caden has hired to play himself within the play, is a bit too perfect for the part, and is making it difficult for Caden to revive his relationship with the alluringly candid Hazel. Meanwhile, his therapist, Madeline Gravis, is better at plugging her best-seller than she is at counselling him. His second daughter, Ariel, is disabled. And a mysterious condition is systematically shutting down each of his autonomic functions, one by one. As the years rapidly pass, Caden buries himself deeper into his masterpiece. Populating the cast and crew with doppelgangers, he steadily blurs the line between the world of the play and that of his own deteriorating reality. As he pushes the limits of his relationships, both personally and professionally, a change in creative direction arrives in Millicent Weems, a celebrated theater actress who may offer Caden the break he needs.","play | warehouse | actress | director | theatre director ","21,000,000","172,194","3,081,925",275,246,"Sidney Kimmel Entertainment, Likely Story, Projective Testing Service ","English, German",USA,7.5,"57,918",67,tt0383028,movie

Little known history is that Albert's first wife, Mileva, a brilliant physicist/mathematician, was a major collaborator in the four revolutionary theories that bear the Einstein name for that year.

Weird Tales 3: The Pioneer's Lost Trunk,N/A,2009,N/A,N/A,60,Documentary,Ted Faye,N/A,"Dawn Alden, Oto Brezina, Jack E. Curenton, Saul Dapsis","This documentary looks at two journeys; the first being a group of pioneers who set out from the settlement at Salt Lake, Utah in 1849 on their way to California. They were a mix of gold-seekers, Mormon missionaries, and those simply looking for a better life. Some of them made the unwise choice to take a ""shortcut"" through a place they subsequently named Death Valley. They escaped with just the clothes on their back, leaving behind a trail of animal bones, wagon remains and all their earthly possessions. In December of 1998, a small group of Death Valley enthusiasts decided to retrace the route of those lost pioneers. In a cave along the trail they made an unexpected discovery: a trunk containing valuables and a letter seemingly signed by one of the 1849 pioneers. For days, national and international media were drawn to this Death Valley discovery, but then doubt began to grow about the authenticity of the trunk. Not to mention the fact that it was removed illegally from National Park lands! Filmmaker Ted Faye's documentary recreates interviews with the survivors of the 1849 pioneers in their own words from their journals and memoirs, as well as interviewing the man who filmed the trunk discovery and the skeptical historians who now doubt its authenticity. The viewer is left to decide by him or herself if the trunk is indeed ""bunk,"" or a legitimate artifact now languishing in storage.",,,,,,,"DreamQuest Productions, East Creek Productions, Gold Creek Films ",English,USA,N/A,N/A,N/A,tt1637664,movie

The oldest offspring, Lucas, largely acted as the protector for his younger twins siblings, Tom and Savannah, in light of their dysfunctional growing up, with their shrimper father, Henry, distant and abusive if/when he did pay them any attention, and their mother, Lila, while not doting on them most concerned about appearances and striving for social standing. Now in middle age, Savannah is a New York based poet, Tom, still living on the South Carolina coast outside of Charleston with his wife Sally and their own three doting daughters, taking a break from his high school teaching/football coaching job, while Lucas has long since died while still standing up for himself and his beliefs. Lila, divorced and now remarried with that wealth and social standing she so long desired, receives news that Savannah is in the hospital following her most recent suicide attempt. Not wanting to face the blame directly as she suspects, she assigns Tom to go to New York to speak to Savannah's therapist, Susan Loewenstein, to provide any information of a family history nature that could help in Savannah's recovery. Tom agrees despite hating New York, and it being not a good time since he and Sally are experiencing marital problems, they both just knowing that things between them are not working, and not having been intimate in months. As Tom and Loewenstein (as he calls her) begin their sessions, Tom is slow to divulge the Wingo family problems to her. But he learns that she too is having her own family problems, with her concert violinist husband Herbert Woodruff being self absorbed and condescending, with their young adult son, Bernard, hating both largely because of they predestining his life also as a concert violinist. Tom and Loewenstein's sessions blossom into a friendship and romance, where their talks, in addition to helping Savannah, may help them both in dealing with their own life problems, Tom's which have been long buried figuratively and literally.","new york | south carolina | twin | psychiatrist | shrimper ","30,000,000",,"74,787,599",109,32,"Columbia Pictures Corporation, Barwood Films, Longfellow Pictures ",English,USA,6.6,"12,728",N/A,tt0102713,movie

As his eyes blink open he's faced with the odd sight of a dog looking back at him. Intrigued by this, GUY even asks the dog its name. It's this question that begins to unhinge GUY. He loses his calm. Where he is? Why is he in a field? The dog flees crashing through the brush; as sounds of reality begin to build behind Guy. As he ominously turns to face the noise, a drop of blood trickles down his cheek. Guy is facing a nightmare. A road divides the endless fields. Two mangled cars face each other. The body of a 60 year old FATHER, an 8 year old DAUGHTER and an unconscious WIFE lie before him. Compounding this nightmare is GUY'S memory, or lack of it.

Competitors battle at 360 words per minute, hauling around mountains of evidence called ""cards"" and nearly every debate ends in global nuclear annihilation. In 2005, some 200 teams converged on San Francisco State to compete in the National Championship. The documentary follows four teams, from Michigan State, Harvard, West Georgia, and Berkeley in their quest for the national title. But back in 1969, debates were slower, more theatrical, and less technical. At the 1969 National Championship, a debate team from Harvard prevailed over the University of Houston. And Michael Miller from the Houston team has never been able to let go of that defeat. Miller, now a retired lawyer, discusses his life-long obsession with debate, his suicidal ideation, his ruined romances, and the self-hate borne of the loss to Harvard 37 years earlier. As the 2005 championship progresses and the competitors are slowly eliminated, we are left wondering who will find themselves inheriting Miller's legacy. DEBATE TEAM is not simply a chronicle of the thrill of victory and the agony of defeat, but a more disturbing examination into the nature of competition itself and the American fetish with championships and champions.","debate | team | college ","45,000",,,,1,"Green Lamp Pictures, Long Strand Studios ",English,USA,9.8,11,N/A,tt1706678,movie

Then they will each be off to start their new lives apart. Only one problem ---- neither one wants to part with their 1994 Jeep Wrangler. So now what? Fortunately, Harley, a long-struggling comedy writer, comes up with a novel solution: whichever person makes the most money by the end of the yard sale gets to keep the Jeep. So, with the bet in place, Harley and Renee (a loving, level-headed woman) proceed to ""sell off pieces of their lives"" to the quirky, offbeat, and often hilariously bizarre people that always arrive at yard sales! And during the constant haggling with buyers over the dozens of items that Harley and Renee are selling, the items often lead to ""flashbacks"" of incidents that occurred earlier in the couple's marriage,giving us a unique insight into how and why their relationship spiraled downward, ultimately leading to their pending divorce and this unique ""Yard Sale.""",,"800,000",,,3,1,"Cannes Artist Productions ",English,USA,7.8,44,N/A,tt0408351,movie

Joe Casey has just died, and his family has gathered at the Casey house for the upcoming funeral. We first meet Joe's wife of forty years, Marilyn. The marriage between them was motivated by social expectation, not love. In keeping with the tradition in this type of marriage, Marilyn held the family together. Then there's Joe's youngest daughter, Barb. Barb has a slight physical handicap and at age 36 still lives at home. She has grown very dependent on Marilyn, out of habit not necessity. Next is Ellen, Joe's oldest daughter. Ellen left home when, at 18, she got pregnant and married. Since her divorce she has been independent, avoiding commitment and responsibility. Finally, there's Ellen's daughter Christy. Since her parents' divorce Christy has lived with her father, and for the last 10 years she has struggled to develop a relationship with Ellen, something Ellen has been avoiding. Christy's memories of the family are childhood memories of weekends at grandma's house, playing scrabble and drinking coke floats. Turns out, Joe's good reputation in the community never made it home, and the four women struggle to overcome Joe's previously unknown financial debts, as well as the damage he caused to each of them and their relationships with one another. Meanwhile, Ellen and Marilyn annoy Christy with their humorous approach to planning a funeral for the disdained deceased, and things get especially out of hand when the obtuse Barb implements her own funeral plans. Ultimately, the four of them are never more than one revelation away from digging their own graves, and the final revelation about Joe challenges their understanding of forgiveness and loyalty.",,"10,000",,,2,,"SevenDreams Films ",English,USA,8.1,40,N/A,tt2768052,movie

Their specialty: targeting the elderly. They find the aged to be the perfect prey, soft targets that put up little resistance out of weakness or fear or both. And, as Scat is fond of saying, ""old people have good shit."" The thugs' latest target for entertainment and enrichment is an elderly couple, PHILIPE and EMILIE BAPTISTE. The couple lives in a once proud house in New Orleans' lower Garden District. While the house is showing its age, the relationship of the couple within its walls is as warm and welcoming as the home that lies within. A backyard garden stands in stark contrast to the peeling paint of the Baptiste's home. The colorful plot is well and lovingly tended - and the object of Philipe Batiste's daily devotion and labor. The garden is the source of the old couple's pleasure until Scat and Clod make it the source of their perverse entertainment. For the past several weeks, Scat and Clod have shown up daily, with six-pack and cigarettes in hand, and taken a seat on the wall that surrounds the garden. They have entertained themselves by hurling insults and threats at Philipe as he works in the garden below. Philipe, for his part, not only ignores the two thugs, he refuses to even acknowledge their existence; he merely goes about his daily chores. The old man's lack of response, his refusal to be intimidated, only serves to infuriate Scat more. The thugs' verbal abuse escalates to physical abuse. One day, Scat and Clod wait on the garden wall but Philipe never appears. In response, Scat and Clod pull a few bags of garbage from trash cans on the street and toss them into the garden to teach Philipe a lesson. The next day, on their way to the garden, they see a black wreath on the old couple's front door. They decide that either the old man or his wife has died. When they reach the garden, they're surprised to discover that the garbage is still strewn over it. Scat is then certain that it's Philipe who has died. The thugs decide to burglarize the home. That night, dressed in black, they return, equipped with flashlights, a pry bar, and a plan.

The captives are kept isolated in single cells, forced to wear dingy, weathered, uniform-like clothing, and are selected special diets that are custom tailored for each individual.

How did our thirty year fascination with Crumpet come about - and why did it end? What does it say about the unique British sense of humour - and about our changing attitude to sex? With contributions from Honor Blackman, Ingrid Pitt, Madeline Smith, Hill's Angel Sue Upton, Leslie Philips and Wendy Richards, and with cultural commentators like Dylan Jones, Germaine Greer and Ned Sherrin, Tony gets to the bottom of this uniquely British phenomenon.","carry on | innuendo | breasts | buxom woman | lads mags ",,,,1,,"Scarlet Television ",English,UK,7.9,27,N/A,tt0496266,movie

'Colossus' will drill deeper than any rig ever has, a fact that gratifies Nexecon CEO, Peter Brazier, but that has geologists the world over up in arms, concerned that delicate ocean floor fault lines could be disturbed with catastrophic effects.

Cooper had a rare combination of mechanical skills and entrepreneurship. Beginning work in a glue factory, Cooper developed the household uses of gelatin (Jello) and fashioned the iron I-beam from railroad rails, which enabled multistoried building construction. In 1828 he founded the Canton Iron Works in Baltimore which made his fortune. A champion of 20th century communication, he helped fund the first transatlantic telegraph cable and built the first American steam locomotive named ""Tom Thumb."" When business success brought wealth, Cooper used it to foster social justice. He founded The Cooper Union for the Advancement of Science and Art in 1859, realizing his dream of free education for working people, regardless of ethnicity or gender. The college empowered thousands of women, a radical notion for the mid-19th century. The Great Hall in Cooper Union provided a platform for most major social movements of the 19th Century, most importantly, Abraham Lincoln's speech that won him his party's nomination for president in 1865.

Pat Metheny Group: The Way Up - Live,N/A,2006,N/A,31 Oct 2006,90,Music,Steve Rodby,N/A,"Lyle Mays, Steve Rodby, Antonio Sanchez, Cuong Vu","Pat Metheny fans know by now what to expect from a recorded performance by the guitarist and his group, and it's all here on The Way Up - Live: superb, versatile musicianship, mixing virtuoso soloing with telepathic ensemble interplay and sustained moments of majestic passion and intensity; intricate rhythms and time signatures; sweeping textures punctuated by some memorable melodic passages; and, from a purely technical standpoint, superior sound and visuals. Yet The Way Up is a bit different, and a good deal more challenging. First heard on the group's 2005 CD of the same name (this performance was recorded in Seoul, South Korea), it's a long, ambitious piece of music consisting of four lengthy parts, all played without pause. For a live audience, it's more like taking in a classical music concert than a jazz or rock show; there are melodies and grooves, but no tunes, per se, as the piece mostly lacks the song-like appeal of much of the Metheny Group's best known work. Composed by Metheny and Lyle Mays, his longtime partner and keyboardist, the music constantly evolves over the course of its 70 minutes (Metheny himself changes guitars like Cher switches costumes), to the point where you might not actually recall much of it when it's over. But you'll certainly remember the experience of watching and listen to these seven brilliant musicians at work; and like the Seoul audience, you will be wowed.

Her best friend Mona wants to go to Cooper Union and that spells trouble for the aspiring photographer. Michael, Maria's boyfriend, is flunking out. No matter, Michael is on a mission yet unknown to him -- call it destiny or revenge. Like many teenagers, they are making choices that will shape their lives. Maria loves Michael more than anything in the world but that love is blind. Her father knows it. Maria will have to see for herself. Mona needs to choose between Seneca, a Monroe track star, and Sam, a Cooper Union art student. Her crisis is a well-kept secret till her mother finds out Sam is a girl. Michael sees the future through the bars of the past. As a child he watched his mother die at the hands of drug dealers and his father never did anything about it. Michael refuses to be like him. When his best friend is killed by the local drug dealer, Michael goes after him. Genuine experiences inform the lives of the three teens. Portraying the lives of inner city girls like Maria and Mona sets this urban drama apart. These portraits of Latina adolescents are memorably different, yet their struggle is universal.

But Max became a national traitor equally fast, when he then accepted the against-all-odds job of turning the totally hopeless West-German basketball team - of all people! - into European winners. Max always maintains that Germany - where he was born before the war - means nothing to him, and that training their national team is just another job on his path to NBA glory. But things aren't as simple as he refuses to speak German to the young players. The only person he seems to be able to relate to is a Turkish immigrant woman Deniz, and her cheeky teenage daughter Sema. Max just about falls in love with Deniz - and does succeed in reinventing the Germans as European champions. When he discovers what happened to his own family in the 1940s - it is not what he had expected. And he will realize that one cannot run away forever from one's own past and demons.

In 1988, at the age of 24, Gotti Jr. became a ""made man,"" and was officially inducted into the Mafia, making him the heir-apparent to head the Gambino crime family and follow in his father's footsteps.

During the years that followed his father's death, Gotti Jr. had a long legal battle ahead of him and served three jail sentences, totaling approximately nine years, for a variety of charges.

But Harmon is a different story, upon arriving, he encounters two drunks and asks them to come with him to cool off, one of them pulls a gun on him and shoots, Harmon with no other choice shoots him. He is told that the man he killed is the brother of Arch King, a powerful man, who adheres to only one law, his. Later that evening someone breaks into the jail and lets the other man out and shoots him with Harmon's gun. It seems that the other man is also King's brother. Most people think that Harmon shot him but a Mexican boy whom Harmon allowed to sleep on the floor of the jail said that it was two men and that one of them's a soldier. Harmon is then visited by King and is told that unless he can prove that he was not the one who killed his brother, King will be back and will deal with him in his own way. Harmon then rides out to the army fort to tell them that one of their soldiers was one of the men who killed his prisoner. It seems that Harmon is not well received by the army, it seems that years ago, his family was killed and he believes that soldiers were involved, so wherever he is assigned, it's always near an army fort or base.","marshal | western town | bar shootout | street shootout | swimming ",,,,13,5,"Aaron Spelling Productions ",English,USA,6.3,265,N/A,tt0066599,movie

Barefoot Bobby Briggs, the legendary running back for the Austin Steers was today sentenced to die for his role in the armed robbery/murder at a downtown Stop 'n Go convenience store... It's five years later, and Bobby's appeals have all but run out, and the Austin Steers are - once again - on the march to the Superbowl, with a lock on the playoffs, when their wide receiver has a season ending injury. With their playoff hopes in shambles, the Governor of Texas controversially offers Bobby a furlough # from death row # to help rescue the Steers' post-season hopes, and even play in the Superbowl. Death & Texas chronicles the bizarre story of Bobby Briggs, whose pro-career was cut short when he was sentenced to die. Guided by implacable anti-death-penalty advocate Marshall Ledger, Bobby plays the only card he has left # his undoubted prowess on the football field. The final days of his appeals to the courts and the Governor play out side-by-side with the Steers' Superbowl hopes. With his execution scheduled for the day after the big game, it all comes down to a Hail Mary pass... Satirical, funny and unashamedly political, Death & Texas parodies the legal system that attempts to sanitize and legitimize the killing of its own citizens. Shot ""faux verité"" style, the film examines the trial and its fairness, and interviews all the key people in Bobby's life: his lawyers, family, the politicians, judges and prosecutors; the victim's family and many more who determine Bobby's fate. Beyond interviews, Death & Texas looks at life in the Texas correctional system, peaks behind the scenes of pro-football and of course, the man himself: Barefoot Bobby Briggs.","mockumentary | black comedy | capital punishment | satire ",,,,2,6,"Death & Texas, LP ",English,USA,6.1,79,N/A,tt0356515,movie

First there is Edu Okoye, a talented singer and a man of deep faith, Edu's spirituality is helping him combat cancer, that and the love of his wonderful girlfriend Tracey. Edu's older brother Ugo, is almost the polar opposite of Edu. Edu is calm, reflective and peaceful whereas Ugo is hotheaded, impulsive and at times menacing. Ugo has also chosen a very different path than Edu, a life of robbery and crime and though Ugo knows he is on a path of destruction, the life he has chosen is not an easy one to leave and according to his gang leader Scorpion, a life he won't be allowed to leave easily. Another issue is Edu's cancer is worsening and Ugo needs to stay in his life of crime to pay for surgery his brother desperately needs. A violent crime leads to Ugo stashing a large amount of cocaine at the house he shares with Edu. He plans on selling this to cover the surgery Edu needs but what Ugo doesn't realize is he has been monitored by the police. As they break down the door, they apprehend the totally shocked Edu just as Ugo escapes. Caught 'red-handed', Edu takes the blame for his brother, partially because he doesn't believe his brother is capable of such a crime and partially because he loves his brother too much to 'rat' on him. For his silence he is given three years in prison. Shortly into his sentence Tracey simply disappears. Edu is released, feeling empty but determined to get his life back on track. Ugo however continues to embark in a life of crime and it only becomes a matter of time before their two worlds smash together.","brother | love | singer | friendship | family relationships ",,,,3,,"KevStel Group ",English,USA,9.3,18,N/A,tt3428882,movie

The Empress possesses a scepter which controls Izmer's Golden Dragons. To challenge her rule, Profion must have the scepter, and tricks the Council of Mages into believing Savina is unfit to hold it. Knowing that Profion will bring death and destruction to Izmer, Savina must find the legendary Rod of Savrille, a mythical rod that has the power to control Red Dragons, a species even mightier than the Gold. Enter two thieves, Ridley and Snails, who unwittingly become instrumental in Savina's search for the Rod. Joined by a feisty Dwarf named Elwood, and helped by the Empress's expert tracker, the Elf Norda, the young heroes go in search of the Rod of Savrille. From the deadly maze of the Thieves Guild at Antius to an Elven Village, secret grotto and abandoned castles, Ridley and his band must outwit Profion's chief henchman Damodar at every turn while, back in Izmer, Profion prepares to do battle with the Empress.

Giorgio has a close relationship with his mother, ANNA, who owns a small vineyard out in the country, but suffers from the fact that his mother has never revealed the identity of his father. Anna is currently in dire financial straits and in urgent need of a bank loan after a fire at her vineyard. Giorgio wants to help her, but that means getting a better-paid job. Everyone loves Giorgio, especially women. His best friend is SARA, a pretty young student at the academy whom he has known since his childhood. Thanks to his mother's friendship with LORENZO MARETTI, head of the famous Maretti fashion firm, Giorgio is given the chance to be interviewed for a job by Lorenzo's partner, GIOIA # and Giorgio's idea of offering fashion items for sale via the Internet meets with a very enthusiastic response. Gioia and Lorenzo have been living together as a couple for several years and have a daughter, CHANTAL. But Lorenzo is married: his wife MARIA is seriously ill, and he cannot bring himself to leave her. Giorgio is hired by the Maretti company and is soon on the way to a great career. Soon, he spends a passionate night with Sara. Sara is well aware that he prefers to be free and unattached. The situation is very difficult for her, but she decides to leave him in peace. When she realizes that she is expecting his baby, she decides not to say anything to him about it. Giorgio travels to Germany, to hire a model there named HEDRA for the fashion presentation in the Internet. She, too, starts an affair with him. Meanwhile Sara has given birth to her child and has also become a professional success: she has set up a thriving firm specializing in unusual knitwear. At the same time Chantal contracts leukemia, and can only be saved by a bone-marrow transplant. During the search for a suitable donor, ideally a blood relative, the truth comes to light: Giorgio is Chantal's cousin. His father is none other than Lorenzo's brother MARCO, a successful executive who is interested in nothing but his own business deals. Thanks to Giorgio's bone-marrow donation, Chantal gets better again. Shortly after this, Giorgio sees Sara again # with a child in her arms. He finds out that he is the father. Then he offers to help with the baby, but Sara refuses, saying she can manage quite well on her own. At work, Giorgio is getting competition from NICOLA, a young computer science expert whom Hedra hired for the Internet project. One night Giorgio makes love to Gioia # she and Giorgio have been increasingly attracted to one another for some time now. Yet Giorgio knows that Gioia belongs to Lorenzo, whose wife has since died. Giorgio feels increasingly dissatisfied with his existence, and when Hedra decides she no longer wants to continue working on his project, he realizes the time has come to change his life. He doesn't want to turn out like his father, who puts freedom above everything else # ending up terribly lonely. He does everything he can to win back Sara, whom he has never stopped loving, adamant that his child will not grow up without a father.

Senzo secretly dates and falls in love with a mortal grade school teacher, Sandra L. Springfield. She's intelligent, gentle, sweet, and eager to learn about Senzo. Yet she has no idea that witches and warlocks really exist. Senzo asks for her hand in marriage, and she agrees not knowing that he is a warlock. He is forced to eventually confess his secret to Sandy at the risk of losing his magic if she decides to leave him. She accepts his proposal and their journey together begins. Here comes the in-laws. . . Overall, ""THE LOCKHAVENS"" illustrates that as a society, we should accept each others differences because looks can be deceiving. It should be noted that the central couple is considered 'mixed', being Warlock and Mortal although they are seemingly the same race. This further demonstrates that, as a human race, we all really have the same problems when it comes down to it.","warlock | love | magic | top | network ","15,000",,,,2,"LoveReign Entertainment ",English,USA,7.6,12,N/A,tt1618395,movie

Having been publicly dumped, Zack defends his discomposure by stating that Taylor is all make-up and wonder-bra and he can make any ordinary girl a prom queen with a similar package. His high-school buddy, Dean Sampson, engages him in a bet following this statement and picks the geeky looking Laney Boggs out of the crowd as the girl Zack must transform into the new prom queen. Zack agrees since he has no option, but as time passes and Laney begins to transform, Zack begins to find her attractive. While all that falls beautifully in place, it's not your typical fairy-tale. Throw in Dean Sampson to complicate the situation, as when he first made the bet he never thought that Zack could rise to the challenge but looking at how Laney has transformed, it looks like Zack could be on a winning streak.","prom | bet | high school | prom queen | friend ","10,000,000","16,065,430","63,319,509",389,94,"Miramax, Tapestry Films, FilmColony ",English,USA,5.8,"68,015",51,tt0160862,movie

It was a company that rose to the top echelons of the independent film scene in the 90s before financial risk-taking caused its spectacular crash. In 1991 a group of young filmmakers banded together in a NYC loft to make personal films at a time when the ""golden age of independent film"" was underway with the emergence of the Sundance Film Festival. As independent film became a household word, The Shooting Gallery found ultimate success with the Academy Award winning, ""Sling Blade"". But success came at a cost. Many of the original founders of The Shooting Gallery left as business self-interest replaced the earlier common purpose. Soon the Shooting Gallery was rapidly becoming a ""new media"" company whose very expansion was being funded by Wall Street money generated by the Internet craze of the go-go 90's. It was in this expansion that the seeds of the Shooting Gallery's demise were sewn. As Hollywood began cashing in on this new ""Independent Film"" genre, the indie landscape shifted by the late 90s.

Caroline, beautiful, hard-working, annoying and seductive, is a staunch supporter of François Mitterrand and is determined to succeed. Matt, a supporter of Michel Rocard comes from a family of steel workers in Lorraine and is proud to be the first in his family to escape his social status. Abel, a righteous young idealistic altruist, is the only one of the group already working (as a lawyer) and to have a wife and child (a little girl), whereas Laure and Louis come from a long line of aristocrats used to serving the State. The president and the government of France have been part of the right-wing party for more than twenty years and the students of the ""Voltaire promotion"" swear to themselves that they'll internally change a system they deem unfair and obsolete, starting with the man running their school... Determined to change the world, their arrival at the ENA marks the beginning of their political hopes and dreams. Abel wants to influence the way things go at the highest level of French administration. Caroline can't stand the system's unfair nature. Laure thinks that François Mitterand's election will restore the social balance. But their years spent at the ENA, during which victories and disillusions follow each other, confront them to the spirit of competition, to their personal ambition, to the system's injustice, and are just a rehearsal for what awaits them once they've graduated in 1980: the first round in a savage struggle for power. Hardened by their first experiences in the field, in embassies and police headquarters in Corsica and Africa, some learn how to use every weapon at their disposal. Others, constantly torn between their childhood dreams and their new responsibilities, struggle to embark on the path of compromise. For History does not wait. Called to the front lines a year later and propelled, thanks to François Mitterrand's victory, into the arcane mysteries of the State, these young ""énarques"" will be asked to make choices on which their careers, and France's future, will equally depend.","career | ambition | student | 1980s | assault ",,,,,,"Capa Drama, Canal+, Arte France ",French,France,7.7,132,N/A,tt1356937,movie

Winner of the Grammy for Lifetime Achievement and member of the Country Music Hall of Fame, Glen was the first country music star to cross over to the pop charts, opening a new realm of opportunity for generations of country musicians. In 2011, when Campbell was diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease, he joined forces with his family to fight the biggest battle of his life. Glen and his wife, Kim, made history by going public with the diagnosis - the first time a major American celebrity would share this experience with the world. The Campbell family then embarked on a short ""Goodbye Tour,"" but the three-week engagement turned into an emotional and triumphant 151-show nationwide tour de force. This epic human drama about the undying bond between Glen and Kim, and their unwavering caring for each other, chronicles a story of love, resilience and the power of song. GLEN CAMPBELL...I'LL BE ME is the true tale of how America's greatest country star would not give up his music or his family, against all odds.

When he ventures into national television by landing the 6 PM time slot on MSNBC, Cenk's uncensored brand of journalism is compromised as he becomes a thorn in the side of traditional news media; his unwavering dedication to speaking the truth puts him at the very nexus of the battle between new and old media, and makes MAD AS HELL not only entertaining, but incredibly timely as well.",,,,,7,14,"Wrecking Crew ",English,USA,7.1,294,51,tt1826550,movie

The series is not a ""parody"" of paranormal reality shows, Admittedly, Ghost Trek pokes fun at all the ghost hunting programs but it's much more than that. Ghost Trek is a high-brow meets low-brow satirical indictment of reality TV, generally speaking. In the all-new Goomba Body Snatchers episode, the Ghost Trek fans are lined up around the block to attend a panel show and live broadcast hosted by Rick Weiner (Tim Ross) of the Real Divorcees of Los Angeles County and he really has Zeke, Jules, and Scary Carrie under the microscope. Harvey nixes Shawna's attempts to get Zeke fired and sends her to Cabo to stay at his condo. Clairvoyant Guy Swisher visits via satellite from the set of Psychic Brats. Scary Carrie continues her unrelenting haze of the newbie, Jules Partridge. Zeke is called out about his tryst with Svetlana on live TV. The Bomb is in the hospital due to a hand bite from Tila Tequila at the ""Gathering of the Juggalos"" and Joey Mayhem is accidentally dosed with a heaping helping of mushroom-laced omelets right before lockdown. The Gambini & Sons Mortuary is haunted by a high profile bondage photographer and notorious mob enforcer - both dismembered and sold to bio-med companies by a mad junkie doctor.

Many members preferred to adopt conciliatory measures, but Patrick Henry delivered an impassioned speech, arguing Virginia needed a ""well-regulated militia.""

Million is a feature documentary directed by Caroline Ledgin, whom has been dubbed the ""MJ fan expert"" by media outlets. Have you ever wondered what makes Michael Jackson's fans so devoted? Ever think about how much their passion fuels their actions, and wonder why they support the most famous pop star on the planet? And for that matter, have you ever wondered how MJ himself became such a global phenomenon? All those questions will be answered in this film which gets deeply involved with Michael Jackson fans on the most intimate levels. This film was shot mostly at the child molestation trial in 2005 (as well as in other areas of the U.S. and Europe); additional footage was filmed after MJ's unexpected death in 2009. The focus of this documentary is on the fans' support during the accusations against MJ, as well as these supporters' devastation experienced after his death. It was this devotion and connection fans feel/felt, that was the true inspiration for the film. The world of MJ fans is foreign to most; this film set out to explore this world that so many don't understand. The film exposes the most die-hard, most loyal and devoted fans, and gets into their hearts and minds so the rest of the world can gain a deep understanding of those who have supported Jackson throughout his life.","fanatic | neverland ranch | santa maria ","450,000",,,,,"Inquiring Minds Films ",English,"USA, Netherlands",N/A,N/A,N/A,tt1619884,movie

Now after nearly seventy years the true story can at last be told of how a handful of unsung heroes assisted the most famous escape of the war. The top-secret unit run from Virginia was known as MIS-X and the handful of soldiers sworn to life-long silence assisted escape attempts from all 64 German camps scattered across Eastern Europe. The Prisoners of War received contraband successfully smuggled into the camps through packages sent by factitious organizations run out of Fort Hunt. But MIS-X also transformed the POW's into spies along the barbwire front. The prisoners even escaped the camps to gather intelligence that was sent back to Fort Hunt in coded letters. But this jeopardized their status as POW's with protections guaranteed under the Geneva Convention. That is why the operation remained one of the best-kept secrets of the war.,,"280,000",,,,,"Edge West Productions, Edge West, Henninger Media Services ",English,USA,8.3,6,N/A,tt1460634,movie

Its basic building block is the eternal fight between God and Satan. ""Securitatea"", then the Communist State Security Service, spots out an illegal religious sect. David, a colonel serving with Securitatea, is assigned to eradicate the sect. He arrests the leader of the sect and subjects him to a series of sadistic interrogations. During the interrogations, David's mind blurs out. He gets revelations from the World of Darkness, and starts acting as a demon-possessed man. The leader of the sect vanishes. Diagnosed as a madman by a psychiatrist, David is dismissed from Securitatea. Eight years later, David senses the presence of his Master in the surroundings, but cannot locate him. Then, he sees on the news the former leader of the sect, who returned to Romania as a film producer. He's the Master, David has no doubt, the former leader of the sect, now a film producer, is his Master. But, as David was not cursed by God to be a Demon, he gathers the last of his strength and attempts to kill the Master. Consequently, David is arrested and taken by the police to a hospice. As all these unfold, several young women are murdered in Bucharest (the Capital City of Romania), the killings becoming braking news. The psychiatrist who diagnosed David as madman, and - who possesses psychic powers, envisions the next young woman that will be murdered. He calls and leaves a message on her answering machine. The young woman is indeed killed. Looking for clues, the police search the young woman's residence and hear the psychiatrist's message. They talk to him, and the psychiatrist relates David to the murders. The lieutenant in charge with the investigations into the killings knows that David cannot be the killer. David was under surveillance in the hospice at the time the young woman that the psychiatrist tried to prevent was murdered. The lieutenant suspects that they are dealing with a serial killer, as sex was performed on each corpse after the killing. What the lieutenant does not know though, is that the sex acts were videotaped for commercial purpose. David escapes from the hospice, and his daughter is kidnapped. His senses take him to a forest that spreads beyond the city limits, where his Master performs the killing rituals. The Master is the actual killer. He ordered the kidnapping of David's daughter. David's daughter is obviously next on the Master's list, but David's appearance in the forest complicates plans. Eventually, David is asked to perform sex on his own daughter. Instead of having sex with his own daughter, David kills her. Then, he gets killed. Was David cursed by God to be a Demon? In the life after, David defeats the evil spirit, who reincarnated itself into the leader of the sect, then into the producer.

Make-up wizard Phil Leakey was the first artist ever to be given on-screen credit for""Special Makeup Effects"". Using unusual chemicals and materials, Leakey strived to create greater realism in his fantastic effects and in so doing engineered the transition from science fiction to full colour, gory, gothic horror. In this lively documentary, Phil takes us back to the Brat Studio years, and explains how the effects were achieved for Stolen Face, The Quatermass Xperiment, Quatermass 2, X The Unknown, The Curse Of Frankenstein, and Dracula. ""Hammer had no laboratories or ovens or anything to cook rubber prosthetics with. I had to take them home and do it. I used to ring up my wife and say: don't cook anything tonight dear I'll need the oven to bake a rubber head.""

Her husband's business trips leave her home alone for long periods of time and her desire (and mind) begins to wander. Coming home from a particularly excessive trip, Nemo discovers that Patty has been having an affair, and the fists begin to fly. Patty defends herself with a kitchen knife, planting it in her husband's back- opening up her mind to a new world of paranoia, mistrust, and madness. A macabre tale ensues, as Patty meets several strange caricatures along the way: A naive farm boy, cannibalistic backwoods hicks- could these people be real? Or do they only exist in her mind, a place just as dangerous?

Having invented a revolutionary technology that can pinpoint and recreate specific memories, his research is abruptly cut short as government funds are re-distributed in an effort to combat the severe issue of ultra-violence that plagues society. Approached by Dr. Rachel Porter (Emily Holmes) of the Mansingh Research Centre (MRC), Adam is given the opportunity to breath new life into his research, albeit taking it in a different direction entirely, as part of a government sanctioned project. He is offered the chance to test his technology on a human subject as he has so long craved to do so, recreating the memories of a psychopath in an effort to determine patterns and root causes of violent behaviour, with the ultimate goal of discovering a universally applicable treatment. After wrangling with the ulterior political motives of Senator Edward Frost (Mackenzie Gray), the driving force behind the research at the MRC, Adam makes the decision to separate from the project. Just as he has finally found the time away from work to spend with his loving wife and daughter, the latter is tragically torn from his life in a mass school shooting. Distraught, Adam returns to the MRC with a renewed determination to rid the world of violence, with the hope that no other family should have to experience his sorrow, and in a bid to save his now crumbling marriage.

While the work of Marcus and his partners at the 5 Gyres Institute has raised awareness about the ills of our single-use 'throwaway culture,' plastic debris in the ocean is generally too broken down to identify a source (i.e. what's the source? and who threw it away?). Chartering a ship to collect data across North America's Great Lakes, Marcus and his colleague Dr. Sam Mason, a chemist at S.U.N.Y. Fredonia, set out on their first landlocked research mission, hoping to trace plastic waste to its source. In all five of the Great Lakes, Marcus and Dr. Mason found thousands of micro plastic beads in all of their samples. In the lab, they linked these micro plastic beads to the exfoliates in over-the-counter facial-scrub products. Oceanographer Sylvia Earle began her studies of the Earth's seas in the late 1950s. Over the past half-century, she has witnessed bountiful, pristine waters become overrun by single-use plastic waste. In making his plastics research more accessible to general audiences, Marcus makes a bust of Sylvia's face out of PET (polyethylene terephthalate) - the very plastic that Sylvia has seen sink and clutter the ocean floor.

Fritz initially sees Natalia as his money ticket, but eventually falls for her. However Natalia is suspect of his motives and cannot overcome their religious differences. Also into Sally and Brian's life comes the wealthy Baron Maximilian von Heune, who has the same outlook on life as Sally, but who has the money to support it.

What would come to be coined ""The San Francisco Sound"" served as the basis for a counter-culture revolution that would forever challenge the perception of the American ideal. This movement climaxed in a single California season known as the Summer of Love. The Beat of a Generation is a two hour documentary revealing as never before told the parallel stories of this magical ""summer"" that brought us the ground-breaking music known as the San Francisco Sound and the Haight-Ashbury neighborhood that provided the canvas for this artistic burst of imagination. The documentary unfolds through extensive archival footage and interviews with those who lived in the Haight during the Summer of Love, as well as those who live there now. The story comes alive through the exclusive collection of famed photojournalist Don Aters and the narration of actor Peter Coyote both former denizens of the Haight. And then there's the music. To understand the Summer of Love, as told by those who lived in the Haight, is to see it not only as a movement, but as a grand social experiment. Artists of varied disciplines and like minds made the Haight a neighborhood-wide collective of creative and social freedom. This documentary explores how the communal environment of a neighborhood informed the musical vision of an art form. The San Francisco Sound that the counter-culture marched to shouldn't be measured merely in terms of a change in creative direction. Yes, the Sound charted a radically new musical course. But, it went beyond the song sheet, beyond the recording studio and the concert hall. The San Francisco Sound took to the streets. It was freedom and it was love. It was a way of life. Haight-Ashbury: The Beat of a Generation will guide viewers into the world of the Haight as never before told on film, reminding us that change can come from any city or town, from any neighborhood or intersection; as long as the people yearn for change... and want a hell of a soundtrack to go along with it.","character name in title ","2,000,000",,,,,"Concept One Media, Concept One ",English,USA,6.4,5,N/A,tt1411696,movie

A media, cultural and political watchdog all rolled into with a touch of comedy thrown-in for good measure.","journalist | satire | journalism | yellow journalism | gossip columnist ",,,,,2,"Persistence of Vision Films (I) ",English,Canada,4.0,61,N/A,tt0295267,movie

There is a whole bunch of fun stuff to be doing and Zef is just the big brother to show Tutu how to get into all kinds of (mischievous) trouble. Until their mother and the family herd are taken from them in the dark of one dreadful night by The Badness. To cover up the truth of their fate from Tutu, Zef makes up a story about a rainbow taking their mum to the sky. Now, Tutu needs to find that rainbow and their mum. Zef wants to find a new herd, a new family. Their journey in search of both takes them on a high adventure - with the help of some ditsy rainbow Cranes, a very unusual vegetarian vulture and a few surprising types with some entertaining takes on the jungle. Along the way Zef and Tutu are joined by three other orphaned animals - Chump, a chimp insisting he is the King of the Jungle, Stretch, a very skittish giraffe and Cub, a Prince to the true jungle king. Together, this band of young African animals must find their way across unfamiliar, rugged terrain and face challenges like none they have known in their short lives. Challenges that test the brotherly love between Zef and Tutu as each insists on pursuing his own goal. Proving they have the stuff of all true heroes, the orphans rally around Tutu who believes the rainbow he is seeking is something they have to see with their heart and not their eyes. When they find the rainbow's end, they will find new families. Of this, Tutu is certain. All that finally stands between the animal band and the rainbow's end is The Badness that took their families. It is up to the orphans to stop The Badness from ever taking animal families again.","herd | elephant | animal | jungle | plain ",,,,5,5,"AMPCO Films, Breakout Films, Adelaide Motion Picture Company ",English,"Australia, France",5.1,76,N/A,tt0459272,movie

Considering many different ideas, such as drugs and murder, the main character, Holly (Rhiannon Drake), is thought to have Schizophrenia. Her life starts normally, as she gets ready for work. But a mysterious book is posted, going by the name of the film title, written by ""The Storyteller"". She begins to hear voices, and believes someone is following her. This voice (Iain Stuart Robertson) appears to be behind the camera throughout. She is shown in many different situations, such as asking for money, and having illusions of being in different locations. The voice tells her to take drugs, which she does, but seems to regret it. She scratches herself in stress, but this does not relieve her of her worries. After a series of events, she kills someone in a car park, and shouts at her alternate voice, asking ""Why can't you make me happy?""

Built in 1872, the pier was one of many built on beaches around the UK and helped the tourist industry for this seaside town. Lauchlan uses computer graphics to chart the development of the pier over the decades and its changing face and usage. The documentary also charts a number of significant periods of the pier's history: it was first destroyed by fire in 1917 and then rebuilt five years later. It became an iconic music venue in the Sixties, and played hosts to concerts by The Jimi Hendrix Experience, The Rolling Stones, The Who, Tom Jones, Genesis, Pink Floyd and The Sex Pistols. Re: A Pier features a collection of interviews with those who performed and witnessed this music. When the pier was destroyed by fire again in 2010, the local community set about raising the necessary funds to restore the pier again, and Lauchlan also charts their journey as they work over a six year period to rebuild the pier once more.","fire | pier | fundraising | community | uk history ",,,,,,,English,UK,N/A,N/A,N/A,tt6203882,movie

While coming to one such town, he encounters a smart-mouthed little beggar named Qu Pu Li, who currently lives with a teenage orphan girl named Zsa Zsa Meng in the forest. When Qu Pu Li and San Mao meet, they don't exactly see eye to eye. But after a chance encounter with a brutal (but clumsy) man named Ironhead and some local thugs, San Mao and Qu Pu Li decide to put aside their differences and fight to take Ironhead down. Qu Pu Li is thankful for San Mao's help. As a result, he and Zsa Zsa Meng let San Mao stay at their straw home in the forest until San Mao is ready to leave town. While staying with them, Qu Pu Li and Zsa Zsa Meng warn San Mao to watch his step while he is in the village because it is run by Mr. Chu, a vicious man who knows rare styles of kung fu and wants to control the entire province. No one has dared to challenge his power. But all of that changes when a mysterious Korean wanderer named Eagle shows up and helps the three Kung Fu Kids when Ironhead and his thugs try to tear down their ""Stunt Show."" Later, Eagle assassinates an aid for a local general who works with Mr. Chu to control the village. Eagle is caught in the process and tortured by Mr. Chu's thugs. The Kung Fu Kids decide to repay their debt to Eagle by helping him escape.

Jesus awakes, distraught. What is the meaning of this nightmare? Why are these strangers using his name? Jesus is a simple carpenter, like his father Joseph. Both are presently looking for work, but they've been wandering for days from town to town without finding any. Times are difficult in Galilee. Roman taxes are stifling the country. The hated Jewish tax collectors, viewed by the people as traitors, rob people of their last means of subsistence. Revolts and bands of revolutionary thieves are spreading uncertainty throughout the land. Herod Antipas, the Jewish king, is merely a weak shadow of his feared father Herod the Great. The real power lies in the hands of Caiphas, the high priest. To strengthen his position, he plays the Jewish interests against the Roman interests with religious fervor. His most dangerous opponent is the new Roman procurator, Pontius Pilate. This hard, people despising military man has an ideal comrade in arms in the cynical author and spy Livius. The two callously attempt to keep rebellious Judea under Roman control. Countless crosses with executed rebels line the streets. The Romans, however, observe the growing power of itinerant preachers and prophets with suspicion. The most influential of these prophets is John the Baptist. He fearlessly condemns Roman lust for power, the decay of religious customs and the reprehensible immorality in the house of Herod. After Joseph's death, Jesus feels abandoned and lonely. He believes that he is not yet strong enough to take up his calling. Then his mother Mary tells him how an angel once revealed to her that she would bear a son, and she tells how determinedly Joseph declared his support for this miraculous child, despite the fact that it was not his own. Further, Mary describes the foreign kings who paid homage to the newborn child. Jesus now realizes that it is time for him to follow his calling. He takes his leave from his previous life and from Mary of Bethany, the woman who loves him. From now on, his life is to be completely devoted to his great mission. Jesus visits John the Baptist. In their childhood days, Joseph raised these two as brothers. They remember their first shared visit to the temple, as well as the fact that, back then, it was Jesus who, as a 12 year old boy, went to the temple without his parents' knowledge, in order to teach in his father's house. Now that Jesus is ready to take up his calling, John agrees to baptize him. At the baptism, a glowing dove appears and a voice calls Jesus by name. After the baptism, Jesus retreats to the desert, alone, to meditate. There, Satan appears to him in the form of a beautiful, beguiling woman and a man in contemporary street clothes. Satan shows Jesus all the unhappiness that his teachings will one day bring to humanity and offers him in exchange real, unlimited power over the Earth. Jesus resists the temptation and, now steadfast, returns home. The first disciples are already slowly beginning to gather around Jesus. They still have doubts, however, as to whether their master is really the heralded Messiah. Only Mary trusts in her son. When the wine runs out at her nephew Benjamin's wedding, she is able to talk Jesus into giving everyone a visible sign of his divine heritage. Jesus asks to have the amphora filled with water and transforms it into wine. This miracle allays his disciples' doubts. Through miracles, Jesus succeeds in allaying the doubts of Simon the Fisher and even those of Thomas, the skeptic. They, too, follow him. At the same time, however, Jesus continually perplexes his followers with his incomprehensible behavior. He shuns the Jewish freedom movement lead by the wild Zealot leader Barnabas, for example, and instead accepts the invitation of Matthew the tax collector. Matthew, too, becomes a follower of Jesus, despite the other disciples' mistrust. When a recently discovered adulteress is to be stoned by an angry mob, Caiphas sees his chance expose to Jesus. He invites the crowd to demand a verdict from Jesus. Jesus, however saves the desperate young woman by declaring that only he who is without sin himself may cast the first stone at her. Ashamed, the mob disperses. Deeply moved by this scene, the former prostitute Mary Magdalene joins the disciples. When Jesus wants to go with his students to the temple to pray, he finds the temple court full of traders and money changers. Suddenly overcome with rage, Jesus hurls their stands to the ground and, wielding a whip, drives the profiteers out of the temple. When neither the Jews nor the Romans show signs of resistance, it becomes clear that Jesus will play an important role in Judea's future religious and political development. John the Baptist, in the meantime, has been executed at the wish of Queen Herodias, the wife of Herod Antipas. Jesus mourns his loss greatly, but he can hardly give in to his pain, as more and more people are coming to him to hear his teachings, even though many of these still seem strange and incomprehensible. For example, Jesus preaches that God favors the meek, the poor and the faint. Above all, however, he doesn't put strict observance of the laws first, but rather love of one's fellow man. Jesus doesn't even shun non-Jews, to his disciples' dismay. All attempts by the ambitious disciple Judas to give Jesus' teachings a political twist fail. Judas is forever trying in vain to gain Jesus' support for the Zealots' freedom fight. Finally, when Jesus brings Lazarus, who is dead and has already been lying in his grave for several days, back to life in front of several onlookers, his popularity knows no bounds. Sitting on a donkey, Jesus rides into Jerusalem and is received like a king by an enormous crowd. Caiphas sees a real threat to his religious authority. He goes to Pilate, who, in fact, officially wants to have nothing to do with Jewish religious matters, but secretly has already planned Jesus' death, together with scheming Livius. He was just waiting for Caiphas to take the initiative. This way, Pilate can pretend that he is merely carrying out the will of the Jewish authorities and does not have to take any personal responsibility for Jesus' death. Jesus himself knows quite well that his death is inevitable. At a last shared supper, he bids his disciples farewell. He tells Judas, however, that he should listen to his conscience for a change. Judas has long been contemplating delivering Jesus to the authorities in order to provoke a rebellion and thus to force Jesus to take political action. He leaves the meal to betray Jesus' location to Caiphas' henchmen. Jesus spends his last hours of freedom with select disciples in a garden near Jerusalem. Again Satan appears to him and tries to talk Jesus into avoiding his death. He tries to convince Jesus that, not only will his death be meaningless, but quite the contrary: it will bring that much more suffering and atrocity into the world. He shows him religious wars and witches being burned. But Jesus believes in the love in people and surrenders to Judas, who is approaching with Caiphas' henchmen. While Jesus is being sent back and forth between Caiphas, Pilate and Herod in a cruel farce, being brutally whipped all the while, his disciples hide in fear. Even courageous Simon, who Jesus once called Peter, the rock, denies knowing his master. Jesus is sentenced to death. Undergoing dreadful torture, he is crucified on a hill near the city. When he dies, the sky becomes dark and an earthquake rocks the land. The disciples take him down from the cross and bury him in a cave. Three days later, however, they find the cave empty. Jesus, alive, appears to them and commands them to proclaim everywhere that love has conquered death. Even doubtful Thomas has to believe the miracle when he is allowed to touch the crucifix wounds on Jesus' hands.","roman | jewish | judas | john the baptist | miracle ","20,000,000",,,89,5,"Antena 3 Televisión, Arbeitsgemeinschaft der öffentlich-rechtlichen Rundfunkanstalten der Bundesrepublik Deutschland (ARD), Beta Film ",English,"Czech Republic, Italy, Germany, USA",6.0,"2,240",N/A,tt0199232,movie

Never has pop culture been so fascinated with male friendships. What do they look like? Why are they important? And how do we talk about them without seeming...unmanly? Films like ""I Love You, Man"" or the recent GQ article entitled ""Are You Man Enough for the Man-Date?"" are just a couple of examples of how society is wrestling with what male relationships look like in our evolving society. But even the word ""bromance"" implies a certain awkwardness and an uncertainty about how to refer to these close relationships between men. Early American writer and philosopher, Elbert Hubbard, said, 'My father always used to say that when you die if you've got five real friends you've had a great life.' Five Friends is the story of how one man sought to live that life. Beautifully shot, from the mountains of Southern California to the New England coastline, ""Five Friends"" captures the intimate relationships of a 65-year-old man and his five friends as they reflect on their lives together, support each other in personal struggle and mine the depths of meaningful friendship. Success, conflict, marriage, divorce, fatherhood, children and dying. These men reveal their fears and dreams to one another in a profound exploration of vulnerability and transparency among men.

She reluctantly agrees after a threat by Bella. Despite their Grandma owning and operating a candy store, Jay and Arty don't like their new living situation as they're afraid of their Grandma, and find it difficult to relate to their crazy Aunt Bella, whose slow mental state is manifested by perpetual excitability and a short attention span, which outwardly comes across as a childlike demeanor.

He is hiding out from Hollywood Harry, who wants what Louie stole and is hiding in his small black bag. Jay and Arty's mission becomes how to make money fast so that they can help their father and move back in together, that money which may entail stealing the $15,000 their Grandma has hidden somewhere.

At a time when the German capital, Berlin, was struggling with famine after World War II, Joseph Weizenbaum was soldering and programming the world's first computers. He created the first banking computer in the world, was perhaps one of the first computer nerds ever and pursued an unprecedented career at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, the ""mighty"" MIT in Cambridge, where he invented the first virtual persona, ELIZA/DOCTOR, a program that engaged humans in conversation with a computer. Later, Weizenbaum was branded as a heretic when he began to criticize his colleagues in public. After retiring as a full professor at MIT, he left the United States and is now living in Berlin-Mitte again. Weizenbaum eventually became a ""preacher"", strictly demanding responsibility of each individual scientist, condemning war and arguing that mankind have become insane. The film spans 9 decades of Joseph Weizenbaum's life. It provides a stage for his humorous narrative depicting a World of Yesterday while reflecting on the dawn of the computer age. It follows 84-year-old Weizenbaum on some of his numerous public lessons, effortlessly entertaining overcrowded lecture halls. The old man is an up-to-date chronicler, a chief witness against militarism and the myths of technological progress, but he remains a modest, funny and most reflective story teller. The story line of his life sketches a gigantic picture, too large for a documentary, large enough to easily fill a novel.","computer | scientist | politics | technology critic | jewish history ",,,,,,"Il Mare Film ","German, English","Germany, USA, Austria",6.7,19,N/A,tt0932562,movie

Brown, Frank Burckner, Andrew Greer, Judith Malina","Centered around a 2008 revival of The Brig, the inflammatory 1963 play that exposed the harsh realities inside a US Marine prison, this documentary by Karin Kaper and Dirk Szuszies puts former Marine Kenneth H. Brown's drama into historical perspective - and makes a case for its ongoing relevance - through powerful scenes from the recent production in Berlin as well as illuminating interviews with directors of the play past and present, revival cast members, and the playwright himself. When Julian Beck and Judith Malina, the founders of New York's radical Living Theater, brought The Brig to their stage in the early 1960s, many theater critics - not to mention the US Department of Defense - found it not just obnoxious but subversive. Rooted in the surrealist model of Theater of Cruelty, Brown's claustrophobic vision of young, caged Marines being transformed into automatons - performing a kind of foot-stamping ballet at double-time as they're verbally abused and punched in the gut by their guards - outraged many and stirred others to antiwar action. More than four decades later, with Americans again on the battlefield, the play still strikes raw nerves.

This is a criminal thriller set in the world of the new generation of thirty-something, white-collar workers of modern corporate Russia, a world in which everyone pursues money and power in complete submission to the corporate culture of greed, lies, and treachery. The story opens as Andrey, a low-ranking executive at a large bank, is instructed to take a ""fleshka"", a small, memory flashcard, home to his wife. Andrey's wife, Viktoriya, is his superior at the bank, a position she got after cruelly accusing him of professional incompetence. She is a career woman: cold, calculating, ruthless, and uncompromising, driven by nothing but her lust for money and power, and the things they can get her. The flashcard contains all the hidden accounts where the illegal profits from the bank's many nefarious activities have been deposited. The net worth of this information is over 320 million dollars. Andrey comes home, earlier than usual, where he finds Viktoriya in the arms of her lover, an influential business partner. Livid at this final humiliating betrayal, Andrey decides to seek revenge, not only on his wife Viktoriya, but on the entire corporate hierarchy of the bank. He refuses to give Viktoriya the flashcard, and leaves. He returns to work, where he takes Igor, the bank's computer system administrator, hostage. With the ""fleshka"" in his pocket and Igor at gunpoint, Andrey leaves Moscow, and heads for Fedotovo, a small village on the Unzha River in the Kostromskaya Oblast. He has a good friend there, Aleksey, who once saved him from going to prison. And, over the past few years, Andrey has secretly built a dacha there on the bank of the river. He had hoped that he and Viktoriya could someday leave the the corrupt corporate ""myshinaya voznya (rat-race)"" behind, live there together, and perhaps recapture the lost innocence and love for each other they had once known. But, now his secret dacha will fulfill a new purpose. Andrey knows that everyone -- Viktoriya and his employers -- will pursue him from the ""kammennye dzhungli (concrete jungle)"" on the Moscow River to this quiet country village on the Unzha River. As the hunt for Andrey begins, all think that they will easily retrieve the ""fleshka"", get rid of Andrey, and return to their corporate quest for profits. Each thinks that they will be the one to get the money. But there are questions that, in their haste to get Andrey, none have thought to ask: Did all of this just happen, or is there someone behind it? - Did someone arrange for Andrey to come home early? - And, who, in the end, will get the money?","bank | river | revenge | dacha | treachery ",,,,,,"Flash Entertainment Kinokompaniya, Tsentr Natsionalnogo Filma, Vox Video ",Russian,Russia,4.4,136,N/A,tt0952656,movie

Murray Abraham, Taylor Hackford, Franco Zeffirelli, Christopher Vogler","A journey in the footsteps of the most famous initiate of Italian Trecento, the author of the celebrated ""Divine Comedy"". A poet who has inspired some of the most outstanding minds in History. Since the 19th century, many important scholars have tried to unfold the mystery hidden behind Dante's terzine. During this voyage we will try to go one step further in the understanding of this secret. Our direction will be marked by the traces left by some of the most distinguished authorities in the field of the esoteric significance of Dante's works. Our exploration will follow the suggestions of the most important contemporary researchers in the sphere of esoteric studies and Dante's writings. The voice of a mysterious character interpreting Dante's verses will help us delve into this subject. Two perspectives: the exoteric and the esoteric one. Any profane science can be traced back to another science relating to the same subject, but considering it from a deeper point of view, in the same kind of relationship existing between the higher sense of the scriptures and their literal meaning. A journey into the world of St. John, representing the interior Church and of St. Peter, representing the exterior Church. A poem directly rooted in the sacred texts of the Islamic tradition, in authors like Mohyiddin Ibn Arabi or in writings as the Book of the Night Journey of Muhammad. The distinction of three separate worlds setting up the general plan of the ""Divine Comedy"" is common to all traditional doctrines. We will examine why the ascent to Heaven must necessarily be preceded by a descent into Hell. Through the study of the different manifestations of the western initiatic tradition, from the chivalric orders to the Rosicrucians, we will try to cast a new light on a neglected side of Dante.",,"1,000,000",,,1,5,"L'Altrofilm ","English, Italian, French","Italy, UK, USA, France",5.6,33,N/A,tt2650486,movie

The film portrays the diverse ways that Sam Abell, Abelardo Morell, Mark Klett, Cig Harvey, and Greg Gorman make their own images while exploring the busy streets of Havana and genteel countryside of Vinales. From the quick, and studied street-photography style of Sam Abell, to the unique camera-obscura technique of Abe Morell, the film highlights the diverse art forms within the colorful and complex culture of Cuba. In his first commissioned body of work as a photographer-a year before he traveled to Hale County, Alabama, to complete the seminal depression era work at the Farm Security Administration that led to the book ""Let Us Now Praise Famous Men""- Walker Evans traveled to Cuba in 1933 to document the conditions of the Machado regime for Carleton Beal's book ""The Crime of Cuba"". His work documented a fragile period of Cuba's history-beautifully and honestly depicting the poverty, political turmoil, and cultural complexities. Evans also spent two weeks in the company of Ernest Hemingway, who allegedly paid for Evans to extend his stay in the country to socialize and continue photographing. In the past 80 years, some things have changed in Cuba, while many other things have remained the same. While only time will tell, full diplomatic and trade relations with Cuba are now on the cusp of dramatic change, and the destiny of the longtime friendship of two groups of people who share a great deal in common hangs in the balance. ""Return to Cuba: In the Footsteps of Walker Evans,"" captures a pivotal moment in Cuba's history and provides a beautiful and lively journey to a country on the edge of massive political, cultural, and economic change. From a retired National Geographic photographer, to Hollywood's most famous portrait photographer-the project brought together some of the world's most thoughtful and talented photographers. Of the five featured photographers, some closely re-photograph the locations of Evans' work, while others take a more interpretive approach. The range of photographic styles produced during the project highlights the artistic range and powerful tool of photography. Furthermore, the project allowed for close cultural, artistic, and professional exchanges between Cuban photographers and the American photographers.","cuba | travel | photography | havana | art ",,,,,,"Surface Below Media ",English,USA,N/A,N/A,N/A,tt5897422,movie

Our story begins with David, a scrawny 5'6"", 140 pounder sitting across the gym from the high school Golden Glove boxer, Tyrone Justice. While sitting across from Tyrone, David recalls how he ended up in this predicament. Moving from Boone, Iowa, population 5,000, to Long Beach, California, population 500,000, David finds himself in a different world divided by sub-groups or ""cliques"". After being slammed into the lockers by the jocks while approaching the high school sweetheart, Angela, David learns that in order to exist in this high school, he must join a clique. With the help of quirky Counselor Woods and his infamous ""Book of Cliques"", David attempts to join a diverse variety of cliques including the Asian Imports, Metrosexuals, and the Wizard Card Club. When David fails to connect with a clique, he finds himself sitting the hallway with the high school loner. While sitting with the loner, David spots a group that he has not yet approached. This is the Boxing clique, a clique feared by the whole school. When David notices that even the jocks fear the boxers, he realizes that this is his last chance to gain the school's respect. Crossing the tracks from middle-class West Long Beach, into the poverty stricken East Long Beach, David arrives at the doorway of an all-Black boxing gym. Though David is greeted with laughs and taunting, he is determined to gain the boxers' respect. Receiving pity from the gym's water boy, Bobby, David learns that in order to gain respect from this clique, he must gain Tyrone's. After getting pushed down by a group of boxers, David finds himself challenging Tyrone to a boxing match, which leads him back to his present predicament.

Ward","This 'making of' documentary's subject is the movie Cannery Row (1982), the title which was immortalized in the John Steinbeck novel of the same name, it being the source material. It tells the story of Doc, an ex-baseball player turned marine biologist, played by Nick Nolte, who falls in love with Suzy, a drifter and novice hooker, played by Debra Winger. The two characters share a common loneliness, which one understands, and the other tries not to. The success of the movie is largely dependent upon the chemistry between its two leads. Nolte and Winger are required to act with snakes and learn to jitterbug for their roles. Director David S. Ward was intrigued by the novel, which he considers atypical to other Steinbeck works. He sees it as a love story between two mismatched people who don't let that stand in the way of a happy ending.

As we join Scott, Eric, Dan, and Adam on their crusade to 'save the world', you too may just fall in-love with Uganda and Rwanda, meet some new friends, and change your life for the better. These young men aren't on a vacation, they have gone to work hard, to 'help', doing what they know best. They will visit Internally Displaced People camps and witness the short and long term effects of genocide and tribal wars. They gain a new understanding of the immense devastation HIV/AIDS is creating across the continent of Africa.. But in the course of making life- long friends, as well as, facing the loss of life, the viewer is on this journey as well. We hope you will also laugh, cry, sing, dance, and in the end leave Africa completely different people. In a time when social entrepreneurs and global issues rule the media, this documentary is a truly raw and real look into a once-in-a-lifetime journey that turns into an entire world of friends working together. The power of this film lies in the questions it forces us to ask ourselves. Are we doing enough, what if it's too hard to help people, what does it mean to love people we've never met?

It has been shooted in 8 countries and 9 languages, from West to East, from Capitalism to Communism, from the Black Forest to the Black Sea, flowing between the mixtures, the rafts, and the cultural contradictions of the lands crossed by the great river. Conceived as a road movie, it trails the river from its source in Germany, across Austria and some former Communist countries - Slovakia, Hungary, Croatia, Serbia, Bulgaria, Romania - all the way to its mouth in the Black Sea, on a journey from the past to the future of the Europe. The Danube, with its singular and yet multifaceted point of view, a perspective that remarkably reflects its distinctive character, becomes an unambiguous elusive guide. An allegoric emblem of the journey taken between the spiraling ideals of the modern man; through reminiscences, representations, metamorphoses that have catalyzed the life and the transitions of the Twentieth Century. Sounding the traces of tradition in all their reticence, in places where they clash with the arrogant modernity, the river flows towards its future and accompanies us to the discovery of our past. The Black Sea proves to be a return to the origins, a ""meta-final"" of a backward journey which reveals once again the jagged horizon of contemporaneity.",,,,,,,"Inclouds ","Slovak, German, Bable, Hungarian, Romanian",Italy,N/A,N/A,N/A,tt5490536,movie

The complex portrait also celebrates the vitality of this largely Puerto Rican and Dominican community, showing the strength of their culture, their creativity, and their determination to overcome a desperate situation.

Upset by his parents arguing, Ryan flings his spaghetti and storms away. Ellen, after taking one last opportunity to blame Lenny, goes to comfort her son. Lenny stays behind and sulks. After Ellen awkwardly tries to explain the concept of death to Ryan using the Disney princesses from Frozen as a parable, she herself freezes. When Lenny shows up to help, she ducks out. After distracting his son with a game, Lenny joins her back at the table. But Ellen is buried in her books and won't respond to Lenny's attempts to cheerfully brush aside their fight. Finally giving in, Ellen lets Lenny pull her close. But just as it seems the crisis has been averted, Lenny looks past her to their kid's artwork and sees for the first time that they are actually disguised love letters to his wife from the late (and clearly much-loved) daycare leader.

It was during that time that Americans fell in love with the automobile. As a result, the Sunday drive was born, and with it, so was the roadside pit stop. These rest stops found their place in American culture and became synonymous with day trips. But over the years, many of these small businesses died off. They fell victim to progress, and society stood by as larger franchises pushed them out of business. The Sunday drive became a thing of the past. But in the Santa Monica Mountains, there is a stretch of road where the Sunday drive is alive and well. The Rock Store was originally used as a stagecoach stop in the early 1900's. What began as a simple grocery store in the first half of the twentieth century evolved into a motorcycle mecca. In addition to its fame as a motorcycle haven, the Rock Store gained notoriety as one of the top motorist destinations in the United States, and eventually became an epicenter for star sightings. But despite their success over the years, owners Ed and Vern Savko have not been without their share of adversity. Yet through it all they've remained dedicated to their ideals they established for their small business nearly fifty years ago.

There is shortage of food - those few people who survived, walk with masks on to protect themselves from radiation.

The dormant Angel reacts to the sounds of music - she starts to wake up. Freaks start to relax - they have not heard music for years. Musicians finish playing, the Freak ringleader in a gesture of friendship shakes hands with the leader of the Musicians. At this moment Angel wakes up from her dream, and takes control of the minds of Musicians. Deprived of their own will - the Musicians start to fight with the Freaks, killing them all. One of the deadly strikes splashes blood, which drops on the face of the Angel, who at this point loses all her powers.

Young Jesus, age twelve, walks behind His parents carrying a lamb. Jesus is to present the lamb to the priest as a sacrifice for sins. Once inside the busy, noisy city full of trading and bartering, Jesus and His family sell and buy the things they need before taking the lamb to the priest. Jesus presents the lamb to the priest, and the priest tests Him by asking some questions about the law. Jesus' answers are correct and the priest congratulates Him. Later, the family leaves Jerusalem to travel home only to find that Jesus is missing. Joseph and Mary return to the city after three days of searching and find Jesus talking with priests outside the temple. Jesus is confused that his parents are worried because He thought they would know He was about His Father's business. Jesus returns home with Mary and Joseph and grows into a caring young man trained in the art of carpentry. Joseph's death is shown as Jesus grows into an adult. Sadly Mary says goodbye to Jesus, and He walks into the wilderness. Jesus is baptized by John the Baptist. A white dove is shown flying above and the voice of God is heard saying, ""This is my beloved Son in whom I am well pleased."" Jesus is then led into the wilderness by the Spirit where He seeks wisdom from the Lord by fasting. While in the wilderness for 40 days, Jesus is tempted three times by Satan. Jesus rebukes Satan the final time by saying, ""Thou shall not tempt the Lord thy God."" Satan leaves as Jesus is worshiping His Father. A light from heaven descends upon Jesus. Angels come to comfort, feed and clothe Him. Jesus then returns to Galilee with the power of the Spirit.","jerusalem | passover | temptation | good versus evil | based on the bible ",,,,,,"Nest Family Entertainment, Rich Animation Studios ",English,USA,6.5,24,N/A,tt0956161,movie

Moving back home with her mother Virginia in Tennessee, Marie Ragghianti was able to leave an abusive marriage to eke out a better life for herself and her three young children - the youngest, Ricky, for who she would have to deal with his major health issues - by waiting tables, all the while being able to complete the degree requirements at Vanderbilt to obtain a B.A. in English and Psychology. She is unapologetic in asking a college acquaintance, Eddie Sisk, for a job, he who has just been appointed legal counsel for just elected Tennessee Governor Ray Blanton. In what he considers a win-win situation, Eddie offers Marie a job as the Extradition Officer for the state, a job offer which she accepts. From there, Marie quickly moves up the chain of command, first to become the liaison to the Governor via Eddie on Parole Board recommendations - the role which is meant to be a two way street, where there is an understood quid pro quo in recommendations from the Board to the Governor, and recommendations from the Governor back to the Board - then the actual Parole Board Chief. Through these jobs, Marie becomes more and more uncomfortable in her working relationship with Eddie, the Governor through who seems to be increasingly wanting parole for inmates who have no grounds to be paroled, and even worse wanting full pardons for inmates who have no grounds to be pardoned. As Marie becomes more and more vocally opposed to what the Governor and Eddie want, she will learn how far they will go to silence and/or discredit her. In return, the Governor and Eddie will learn that Marie will not take what is happening to her sitting down, especially as she believes she has done nothing wrong in carrying out the responsibilities of any of her state duties.","corruption | political corruption | politics | political cover up | cover up ",,,,7,8,"Dino De Laurentiis Company ",English,USA,6.7,611,N/A,tt0089555,movie

In ""Heads and Mushrooms"", he's in Maracaibo, Venezuela apparently suffering from slight amnesia. His friend Jeremiah Steiner, a down-on-his-luck elderly former university professor he met and helped in ""Under the Sign of Capricorn"" is keeping an eye on him until he recovers. Influential local antiquarian and Steiner's acquaintance, Levi Columbia, brings them a long lost diary written by a famous explorer who disappeared in the jungles of Venezuela while searching for the legendary mythical city of gold - El Dorado. He suggests that Corto continues the perished explorer's journey since there are clues in the diary to where El Dorado might actually be. Levi will finance the expedition, of course. He also gives Steiner a small bag of hallucinogenic mushrooms that supposedly restore memory. The journey proves to be an ill-fated one. Or does it? In ""Banana Conga"", Corto is in Honduras seeing the Mosquito coast and visiting a daughter of his old friend. He runs into an ambush in progress that ends in carnage. A suitcase is left behind, so Corto claims it. It turns out that every political faction in the politically unstable country, including the US emissary, the anti-government rebels, adventuress Venexiana Stevenson and even ""Golden Lips"" (or ""Golden Mouth""), the friendly mysterious young-looking 200-year-old voodoo medium who knows Corto well, want it for themselves and bodies and back-stabbings begin piling up. In ""Piece in O' Minor for Harps and Nitroglycerin"", Corto arrives in Ireland with a shipment of arms for his friends in Sinn Féin, an Irish anti-British political organization that is about to birth the IRA. They are trying to find a way to release one of their most important members from the British army's hold and all violent options are on the table. Corto doesn't care much about politics, but he'd never say no to a friend. Based on two stories from ""Corto toujours un peu plus loin"" issue and one from ""Les Celtiques"" issue of Corto Maltese comic book by a famous Italian comic book artist and storyteller, Hugo Pratt.","suitcase | factions | honduras | el dorado | venezuela ",,,,1,,"Ellipse Animation, Rai Fiction, Pomalux ",French,"France, Italy",7.2,5,N/A,tt4212102,movie

Dekyi Tsering, known by Tibetans as 'Gyalyum Chemo' or 'Great Mother,' gave birth to 16 children, three of whom were recognized as incarnate lamas. Weaving anecdotal threads and personal reflections from her children, grandchildren, and friends, with never before seen photographs from their family collections and rare footage of Tibet, the film offers an intimate glimpse into Tibet's first family and the woman who inspired them. His Holiness talks about how his mother helped shape the man he is today and the relationship between healthy family and healthy humanity, and how it all begins with a mothers love. Dr. Marion Woodman (Addiction to Perfection), Alice Walker (The Color Purple), and Angeles Arrien (The Second Half of Life) link this uniquely Tibetan story to a much broader perspective of motherhood and how the Great Mother lives within each of us.","mother | tibetan | dalai lama | mother love | buddhism ","350,000",,,,,"Frame of Mind Films ","English, Tibetan",USA,8.0,10,N/A,tt1649793,movie

She started a school and a newspaper, married and had 2 children before returning to the U.S. in 1863 to recruit Black soldiers to fight in the Civil War. As well as an important legacy, she left behind a collection of her personal letters that was lost until 1974. The letters were discovered accidentally by her descendants in the pile of rubble that remained after they had her old house demolished. Her descendants offered the letters to the Archives of Ontario, and the Archives readily accepted and restored the letters. My film recalls her very interesting life in Canada, but also the very good luck that the letters were found. It also explores the fortuitous timing of the letters' discovery. It was at a point after the emergence of ideas about Social History - the history of ordinary people - as well as Women's History and the Civil Rights Movement. Had the letters been found in the 1930s or 1940s, they might not have been offered to or accepted by the Archives. This film presents this astonishing story along with narration by CBC's Adrian Harewood, vintage film footage, original art work by Canadian artist Teresa Fenton, and musical arrangement and performance by Canadian pianist, Jenna Richards.

The importance of Goethe`s and Newton`s theories of colours is an undisputed fact. Especially in today`s reception, the difference in their paradigmatic basis becomes clear. Although Goethe claimed his work to be based on physics, it is primarily considered as a basic work on the psychology of colours, supported by contemporary anthroposophy, by the reception of painters and other representatives of integral ways of viewing things. Newton`s work is more valid with regard to physics. And one difference between them is the analysis of the origin of white, which according to Goethe could not be assembled from darker colours. Here, this is the starting point to transferring their scientific works into a fictional dramatic film action. After the protagonists meet in a forest and meadow landscape, Isidorus is sent to have an encounter with fictional Liora, queen of white light. Her character is designed to combine the aspects of the origin of white with the character of Gretchen in Goethe`s Faust, whose character transcends scientific ideology. The Cavern of white light scenery also deals with Newton`s alleged virginity. Nigel`s character is designed to mirror the intention to incite people against each other by making the most of their different interests and ideologies.",,,,,,,,German,Germany,N/A,N/A,N/A,tt4965150,movie

He says, ""Either you recognize me in school, or we aren't friends at all"". She says okay, then we aren't friends. Richard leaves the field angry. Secretly, Emma follows Richard as he bikes home, and finally rings at his door. He opens, sour. Again she says she is sorry and asks to come in. He lets her in to his room. Richard's room is full of all kinds of exotic things and Emma is impressed. He performs a little drum solo on his drums. Emma invites him to the sofa, and they talk about why Richard is being bullied at. Richard says he doesn't know, it has always been like that. Emma says he is a good and funny guy. Suddenly they almost kiss, but then Richard's mum shouts his name. As Emma and Richard say goodbye outside, Vickan, one of the girls, happen to walk by. She sees them hugging. Next day in school, the girls are standing in the corridor, and Emma walks by. They ask if she has studied for the test. She doesn't even say hello to them, and they mock her. Emma goes to a bathroom. We hear her thoughts as she recalls the things that the girls and Richard have said. She washes her face. The class now has a test. Emma, Richard and the girls are all present. Suddenly Vickan writes a note and passes it around. The students smile as they read it. As it is passed to Emma, we see the text: ""Emma loves Nerd-Richard"" Emma suddenly has enough. She looks around and see the girls giggling. Suddenly she bursts up, walks over to Richard, takes his hand, raises him up and says to the whole class, ""Now it's us, okay?"" She kisses him in front of everybody and the film ends.","frisbee | frisbee golf | peer pressure | love | high school ",,,,,,,"Swedish, English",Sweden,N/A,N/A,N/A,tt1756524,movie

Its creation was inspired by the recent, true-life events in the family of Executive Producer and Starjack Entertainment partner, Pamela S. K. Glasner, and although the film does touch upon the events in Ms. Glasner's family, its focus is much more universal than that, because the problem is, without question, universal. Of all the illegal and illicit enterprises in the world, elder exploitation is among the safest and most lucrative. It is a criminal's dream. It carries the least amount of risk, requires minimal outlay, can be done right from your living room, is virtually unreported by its victims - and then, even when it IS reported, it's perpetrators are practically never prosecuted. The financial cost is staggering; the human cost is incalculable. Each and every day now, for the next 19 years, more than 11,000 Baby Boomers nationally and more than 61,000 Baby Boomers globally** will be turning 65 - and since Baby Boomers control 80% of the personal finances (as opposed to business finance), the world is about to experience the largest transfer of wealth, from one generation to the next, in human history. This quite literally exposes more than 500 million Baby Boomers, plus their already-aged parents, plus their adult children (their beneficiaries) to what will literally become a global epidemic of fraud and financial abuse if this crime-spree is left unchecked.",,"100,000",,,2,16,"Starjack Entertainment ",English,USA,8.5,15,N/A,tt2048793,movie

Flora Simmons, a young musician, escapes a haunting past. Her life scars are not evidence of Imperfection; they are evidence of healing. She's been living in Los Angeles for a year. She can barely pay rent, barely keep a job, or any sustainable relationship. She is nowhere near making her music dreams come alive. We meet Flora at her lowest point. Despite the troubles she faces, she remains youthful. Perhaps, even a bit too much at times. She reluctantly takes a job as a guitar teacher through a foster center. Flora meets Shard, Chris and Jamal, three rambunctious foster teens who remind her so much of herself. As much trouble as they give her, Flora can't help but connect with them. Flora is happy for the first time and realizes they need her as much as she needs them. With the economic situation, this foster home is abruptly shut down due to a lack of funding. The center is closed and classes are canceled. Several of the youth are picked up by their social workers, some return to juvenile hall, others escape and go AWOL. Shard, Chris and Jamal make a break for the streets and run away. Flora finds herself without a job and disappointed with life once again. Flora roams the streets and bumps into the boys at a park. She uses her last pay check to treat the boys to a day of fun. As the boys become attached to Flora, she realizes she has to be stronger so she can care for them. She takes them in, feeds them, clothes them, and shelters them in her apartment. Flora gets an eviction notice and finds herself homeless with the teens. The tables turn. The boys now get to teach her how to survive on the streets. They can hardly make ends meet and battle everyday with the basic necessities. As the situation gets worse, Flora realizes she can't care for them any longer. She is faced with the decision of turning the boys back in to a place they desperately don't want to be in so they can be better cared for.","runaway | foster youth | homelessness ",,,,,,"Brown Eyed Girls Productions ",English,USA,N/A,N/A,N/A,tt2322296,movie

Seacoal,N/A,1985,N/A,31 Jan 2014,82,N/A,"Amber Production Team, Murray Martin",N/A,"Rosie Laidlaw, Brian Laidlaw, Alison Laidlaw, Helen Laidlaw","Betty and her daughter Corinna are introduced to the harsh seacoaling way of life by Ray, an ex-seacoaler returning from a job with ICI. His offer of a caravan on a cliff top and promises of the Klondyke that awaits them at least seem preferable to the violent marriage she has left behind. The film sets Betty's struggle for survival against the wider struggles of the seacoaling community, surviving on the fringes of capitalism. Despite the exploitation by a local entrepreneur, run-ins with dole snoops and School Board men and the ever encroaching regulations of a hostile council, their lives retain a kind of anarchic romance, which is reflected in the film's lyrical style. The inspiration for Seacoal undoubtedly came from the staggering visual location in which it is filmed; the industrial landscape of power station and pit framing the blackened beach of Lynemouth where, for generations, local people and travellers have made their living from collecting waste coal washed ashore. Channel 4 wanted a feature film and Amber suggested this territory. A small commission for the Ashington photographer Mik Critchlow in the early 1980s had, in consequence, opened access to the seacoaling community at Lynemouth, where one of Mik's cousins, Trevor Critchlow, worked. The bleak energy of its raw capitalism had often attracted photographers, Chris Killip among them. The caravan Amber bought on the site housed Chris as he developed his photography project, Seacoal (1984), with its stark images of life at the margins. When he moved out, the Amber crew moved in, making a feature film of the same name, which was released the following year. Seacoal, Amber's first feature film represented a major step forward in its experimental mixing of drama and real life. The production team lived with the seacoalers on and off for two years, and the daily events of the camp were incorporated into the film as straight documentary, improvised sketches or fully dramatised reconstructions. Equity, the actors union, granted Amber special concessions to work with the seacoalers themselves on the condition that they did not script for, or direct them. Amber were unable to predict responses to the actors' lines, which meant that the scripting had to be done piecemeal as the plot developed. The technique paid off, however, in terms of the film's spontaneity. After screening on Channel Four, Sean Day Lewis, from the Daily Telegraph, while devoting most of his TV Choice column to this 'haunting unsung film', nevertheless expressed surprise that this was in spite of it being made by Amber Films, 'a co-operative too devoted to equality to acknowledge the existence of a director or cameraman.'","north east | independent film ",,,,1,1,"Amber, ACTT Workshop Declaration, Channel 4 Television Corporation ",English,UK,7.1,15,N/A,tt0246918,movie

Bart Sellers is one of these people - an unsatisfied, lethargic, pot smoking tattoo store owner. In his youth, he wished to own his own tattoo business - and now that he does - he's dissatisfied with the kind of work he gets to do as a result. Bart spends most of his time to and from work, or lazing around with his two roommates, Brad and Stacy. Just as Bart thought life was going to get any more dissatisfying, a new neighbor moves in right across the street from him. This newcomer approaches Bart and introduces himself as Alan Smith - the squeaky clean, Jesus loving, polar opposite of Bart. Bart ignores Alan until Alan reveals he too is a tattoo artist, albeit completely free of tattoos himself, and Bart's annoyance has suddenly become his number one enemy. Alan draws in the kind of customers that Bart hates - the tramp stampers, the ""I heart Mom's"", the tribal surfer bros. Even though Bart can't stand doing these tattoos, they're also his bread and butter. After Alan discovers Bart smoking pot outside his storefront, he calls the police. Tired of being inconvenienced, Bart sets out to get revenge against his new neighbor, setting off a string of increasingly worse bouts of retaliation from both sides. Alan's mother - holding a secret past from him - and a detective - curious of the domestic disturbance - help unfold the tale that shows that some people just weren't born to play nice.",,"20,000",,,,,"LB Productions ",English,USA,8.1,8,N/A,tt1441456,movie

Rafeeque","Indrajith, Fahadh Faasil, Kalabhavan Mani, Makrand Deshpande","Amen tells the story of people around an ancient Nasrani Church. The plot is set in a village, Kumarankary, where its inhabitants are always garbed in white - a motif which the film deftly employs to meld the elements of fantasy and spirituality. A young, handsome cleric (Indrajith Sukumaran) arrives as the Kathanar (Syrian priest) of the church, whose senior Kathanar is Fr. Abraham (Joy Mathew), a grumpy fellow. The village has a mix of issues, which range from the love between Solomon (Fahadh Faasil) and Sosanna (Swati Reddy) to the fate of a band crushed by frequent failures in contests. The movie sets itself a lot of targets like the fate of Solomon's love, his dazzling self-discovery of a trait not known to him before and some sober spiritual and religious conflicts. Amen promises a luxuriant plot replete with music, faith, fantasy and romance and an amazingly varied set of characters. As the parish seriously discusses whether to retain the church's band that had lost to the rival group in the earlier band competition, a young priest Fr. Vincent Vattoli (Indrajit) takes charge under Fr.Ottaplackan. He is stylish, dares to defy conventions and is in support of the romance between Solomon and Sosanna. His actions irk the senior priest and things take a serious turn after a while. The people agrees to a pact that sets the fate of Solomon's love with Sosanna, and the Kumarankary church band's future.

In White River, Ontario, en route to a training camp in Valcartier, Québec, with the Winnipeg section of the Canadian Army Veterinary Corps, Army Lieutenant Harry Colebourn, who has a natural rapport with animals, saves a black bear cub from being killed by a hunter, who killed the cub's mother. Not knowing what else to do with the cub, Harry brings her along to camp to act as the unit's mascot, who he names Winnie - short for Winnipeg. Most of the men in the unit bond with Winnie, but having such a mascot is against the wishes of the head of the Canadian Expeditionary Force's veterinary division, Colonel Barret. Barret is a tough but fair man, who may have more problems than Winnie in the form of the Expeditionary Force's commanding officer, General Hallholland, a dipsomaniac who uses his position in the army for his own vainglorious purposes. Winnie's stay with Harry and the unit is not always a smooth one, especially in trying to stay under Barret's radar. Over time, Winnie becomes completely tame, craving human companionship, which Harry realizes is a problem as the unit is scheduled to get shipped overseas to England and eventually to France to do their duty on the front lines. Sending Winnie back into the wild may no longer be a viable option, as Winnie has a mind of her own, but finding a home for her where she will get the human companionship she craves or else possibly die from not having what she needs - which means an owner that understands that she's no ordinary bear - may be a problem.","bear | mascot | bear cub | soldier | zoo ",,,,13,4,"Original Pictures, Power, Powercorp ",English,Canada,7.0,670,N/A,tt0437088,movie

One of the employees, Raghu, of these instigators finds that his child has been killed, so he makes a file and takes it to Haji, and is killed shortly thereafter. When Haji goes through the file he finds that the conspiracy involves big name politicians, and he decides to confront one of them. He does so, and is killed, but after leaving the file in a secure location. The big-wigs hire two friends, Veeru and Akbar, to locate the file for a fee, which they do. Then they find out that they have virtually turned over the country to extremists, and decide to repent for their actions by recovering the file and handing it to proper authorities for disposal. What they do not realize is that there seems to be no ""proper authority"" for dealing with such wrong actions, and it appears that everyone is involved in this deep conspiracy to make money for themselves. The two hapless friends now realize the situation they are in, and must prepare themselves and their loved ones against the onslaught that will surely wipe them out from this world.",,,,,,,"Chiragdeep International ",Hindi,India,4.3,13,N/A,tt0482037,movie

F ace Addict, a walk-movie following the thread of memory, tells about the past and present lives of Bertoglio and other protagonists of the downtown scene, through personal reminiscences and original footage and photographs. In this journey toward the rediscovery of New York 20 years later, on the traces of a time long gone and a scattered community, Bertoglio is accompanied by his friend Walter Steding, Andy Warhol's ex-assistant, avant-garde painter and musician.

This narrative short film chooses an experimental approach that confines the story to a single location, as well as positioning the camera in one fixed spot, all with the intent to maximize the emotion and intimacy the audience feels. How much more personal can you get than to spend time with a woman, facing herself in the bathroom mirror? For this is where she puts on her public face and confronts her private fears alone. To further amplify the drama, the film takes the heroine through a life-changing experience ... the diagnosis and treatment of breast cancer. In this way, as well as through the eyes of her family, lover and closest friends, we truly come to know this woman, Taylor, in a manner usually reserved for only the most special people in our lives. Thus, the filmmaker's vision is accomplished: that the audience will walk out of the screening of this movie feeling as though they have a sister, mother, wife, lover or best friend who has gone through the experience of breast cancer -- that each audience member now has a ""personal experience"" with this disease instead of just being a detached observer of the survivors in our midst.",,"50,000",,,5,1,"Carey-it-Off Enterprises ",English,USA,7.3,40,N/A,tt0784833,movie

'Alfred Hitchcock in East London' uncovers the lesser known facts about his early life and pinpoints the key sites from his formative years which still exist today. Featuring a mixture of contemporary footage and rare archive film, the documentary retraces Hitchcock's footsteps around Leytonstone and identifies the old cinema buildings where the young boy was first exposed to motion pictures. His churchgoing in nearby Stratford and his schooldays in Hackney are also explored as well as his lively teenage years in Limehouse during the First World War. For the first time in any study of the director, Hitchcock's associations with the long forgotten Walthamstow film industry are explored and it is revealed how the mechanics of filmmaking were familiar to him long before he began working in the profession. The documentary also tells the previously untold story of his support for an East London cinema during the height of his Hollywood fame. Produced to commemorate the 80th anniversary of Britain's first talking picture 'Blackmail', the documentary paints a portrait of Hitchcock and his roots which is radically different from previous studies.","cinema | london england | theatre history | celebrity ",,,,1,1,"McGuffin Media ",English,UK,N/A,N/A,N/A,tt1547223,movie
